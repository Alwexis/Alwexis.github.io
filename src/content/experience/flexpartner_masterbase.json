    "description": "I worked for Masterbase as a Flex Partner and participated in their internship program aimed at students nearing graduation from Computer Engineering or related fields. During my time there, my team and I developed Condomoonie, an application designed to streamline the management tasks of condominium administrators and their staff. Additionally, while at Masterbase, I identified previously unknown functionalities within the ecosystem as well as potential security vulnerabilities, which I subsequently reported to the team responsible for the design and development of the Masterbase ecosystem.",
