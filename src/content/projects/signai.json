    "description": "SignAI (formerly HERMES) is a Chilean Sign Language (LCHs) interpreter service and an innovation and thesis project aimed at breaking down the communication barrier between deaf, mute, and hearing individuals. We use Artificial Intelligence to translate Sign Language into Text and Voice into Sign Language. The project includes a Deep Learning model, the Service (API), a Developer Portal, the fully digitized Chilean Sign Language Dictionary (LCHs) in a MongoDB database, and a real-time communication app as an example for integration.\n\nThe project has participated in various competitions, with the most notable being: \"Preview Demoday 2024\", where we achieved second place, and \"Demoday 2024\", where we earned first place in the \"Social Impact\" category and second place in the \"Project of the Year\" category. The project has also been featured in various regional media outlets, including radio shows, podcasts, and more.",
